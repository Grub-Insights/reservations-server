- for patch and delete routes, do not include verbs such as update, delete in route endpoint

- could include crud operations for restaurant

- all reservations are associated with a restaurant, so include restaurant in the route
    - since reservations belong to restaurants, include parent information in route

- for things like party size, use query parameters to make filtering simpler
